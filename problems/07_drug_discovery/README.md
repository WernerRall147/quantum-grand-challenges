# Problem 07 · Quantum-Assisted Drug Discovery

## Overview

Drug discovery requires exploring vast chemical design spaces to identify ligands with strong binding affinity and favorable pharmacokinetics. Quantum computing promises more accurate electronic-structure evaluation and molecular similarity search. This problem sets the stage with a classical baseline that scores ligand–protein interaction energy using coarse-grained Lennard-Jones plus Coulomb terms, while preparing a Q# project to host variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments for small active-site models.

## Next Quantum Milestones

1. **Fragment Encoding** – Map small active-site Hamiltonians (H₂, LiH, minimal basis) into qubit Hamiltonians.
2. **VQE Ansatz** – Implement adaptive VQE / UCCSD ansätze using Q# chemistry libraries.
3. **Pose Re-ranking** – Combine quantum energy estimates with classical docking scores.
4. **Resource Estimation** – Benchmark fault-tolerant requirements for chemically relevant precision.

This scaffold keeps the classical baseline reproducible while we iterate toward genuine quantum chemical modeling. 🧪⚛️

## Objective Maturity Gate

- **Current gate**: **Stage B complete** (classical baseline and Q# scaffold/build path are in place).
- **Next gate target**: **Stage C** (hardware-aware validation with uncertainty-bounded comparisons).

Stage C exit criteria for this problem:

- Execute at least one non-placeholder quantum workflow path tied to the problem objective.
- Report uncertainty-bounded comparisons between classical and quantum outputs on `small` and `medium` instances.
- Document transpilation/connectivity and backend assumptions used for reported quantum runs.
- Add calibration/noise-sensitivity evidence for the reported quantum metrics.

## Advantage Claim Contract

- **Claim category (current)**: `theoretical`.
- **Problem class and regime**: Problem-specific challenge instances defined in this directory.
- **Fair baseline**: Problem-local classical baseline in `python/` outputs.
- **Quantum resource scaling claim**: Expected asymptotic advantage depends on algorithm family and implementation assumptions; no hardware-demonstrated speedup claim yet.
- **Data-loading and I/O assumptions**: Must be documented alongside future advantage claims.
- **Noise/error model assumptions**: Backend-specific model and calibration assumptions to be added at Stage C.
- **Confidence/uncertainty method**: To be reported using shot-based confidence intervals or equivalent statistical bounds.
- **Residual risks**: Oracle/state-preparation/transpilation overhead may dominate for near-term instance sizes.
