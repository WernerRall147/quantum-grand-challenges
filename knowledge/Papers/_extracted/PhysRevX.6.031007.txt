We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of molecular hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we experimentally execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissociation energy to within chemical accuracy of the numerically exact result. Second, we experimentally demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chemistry, which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estimation. We compare the experimental performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors. This error tolerance inspires hope that variational quantum simulations of classically intractable molecules may be viable in the near future.

INTRODUCTION Universal and efficient simulation of physical systems [1] is among the most compelling applications of quantum computing. In particular, quantum simulation of molecular energies [2], which enables numerically exact prediction of chemical reaction rates, promises significant advances in our understanding of chemistry and could enable in silico design of new catalysts, pharmaceuticals, and materials. As scalable quantum hardware becomes increasingly viable [3–7], chemistry simulation has attracted significant atten- tion [8–28], since classically intractable molecules require a relatively modest number of qubits and because solutions have commercial value associated with their chemical applications [29]. The fundamental challenge in building a quantum computer is realizing high-fidelity operations in a scalable architecture [30]. Superconducting qubits have made rapid progress in recent years [3–6] and can be fabricated in microchip foundries and manufactured at scale [31]. Recent experiments have shown logic gate fidelities at the thresh- old required for quantum error correction [3] and dynami- cal suppression of bit-flip errors [4]. Here, we use the device reported in Refs. [4,7,32] to implement and compare two quantum algorithms for chemistry. We have previously characterized our hardware using randomized benchmark- ing [4] but related metrics (e.g., fidelities) only loosely bound how well our devices can simulate molecular energies. Thus, studying the performance of hardware on small instances of real problems is an important way to measure progress towards viable quantum computing. Our first experiment demonstrates the recently proposed variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), introduced in Ref. [19]. Our VQE experiment achieves chemical accu- racy and is the first scalable quantum simulation of molecular energies performed on quantum hardware, in the sense that our algorithm is efficient and does not benefit *Corresponding author. pomalley@physics.ucsb.edu †Corresponding author. babbush@google.com ‡Corresponding author. martinis@google.com Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License .

PHYSICAL REVIEW X 6, 031007 (2016) 2160-3308=16=6(3)=031007(13) 031007-1 Published by the American Physical Society from exponentially costly precompilation [33]. When implemented using a unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz, VQE cannot be efficiently simulated classically, and empirical evidence suggests that answers are accurate enough to predict chemical rates [19–23]. Because VQE only requires short state preparation and measurement sequences, it has been suggested that classically intractable computations might be possible using VQE without the overhead of error correction [22,23]. Our experiments substantiate this notion; the robustness of the VQE to systematic device errors allows the experiment to achieve chemical accuracy. Our second experiment realizes the original algorithm for the quantum simulation of chemistry, introduced in Ref. [2]. This approach involves Trotterized simulation [34] and the quantum phase estimation algorithm (PEA) [35]. We experimentally perform this entire algorithm, including both key components, for the first time. While PEA has asymptotically better scaling in terms of precision than VQE, long and coherent gate sequences are required for its accurate implementation. The phase estimation component of the canonical quantum chemistry algorithm has been demonstrated in a photonic system [36], a nuclear magnetic resonance system [37], and a nitrogen-vacancy center system [38]. While all three experiments obtained molecular energies to incredibly high precision, none of the experiments imple- mented the propagator in a scalable fashion (e.g., using Trotterization), as doing so requires long coherent evolu- tions. Furthermore, none of these experiments used more than a single qubit or qutrit to represent the entire molecule. This was possible due to the use of the configuration basis, which is not scalable but renders the experimental chal- lenge much easier. Furthermore, all of these implementa- tions applied the logic gates with a single, totally controlled pulse, as opposed to compiling the algorithm to a universal set of gates as we do. There have been two previous experimental demonstra- tions of VQE, first in a photonic system [19] and later in an ion trap [39]. Both experiments validated the variational approach, and the latter implemented an ansatz based on unitary coupled cluster. All prior experiments focused on either molecular hydrogen [36,37] or helium hydride [19,38,39], but none of these prior experiments employed a scalable qubit representation such as second quantization. Instead, all five prior experiments represent the Hamiltonian in a configuration basis that cannot be efficiently decom- posed as a sum of local Hamiltonians, and then exponentiate this exponentially large matrix as a classical preprocessing step [19,36–39]. Until this work, important aspects of scalable chemistry simulation such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation [40] or the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation [41,42] had never been used to represent a molecule in an experiment; however, prior experiments such as Ref. [7] have previously used the Jordan-Wigner representation to simulate fermions on a lattice. In both experiments presented here, we simulate the dissociation of molecular hydrogen in the minimal basis of Hartree-Fock orbitals, represented using the Bravyi- Kitaev transformation of the second quantized molecular Hamiltonian [17]. As shown in Appendix A, the molecular hydrogen Hamiltonian can be scalably written as H ¼ g 01 þ g1Z0 þ g2Z1 þ g3Z0Z1 þ g4Y0Y1 þ g5X0X1; ð1Þ where fXi;Z i;Y ig denote Pauli matrices acting on the ith qubit and the real scalars fgγg are efficiently computable functions of the hydrogen-hydrogen bond length R. The ground-state energy of Eq. (1) as a function of R defines an energy surface. Such energy surfaces are used to compute chemical reaction rates which are exponentially sensitive to changes in energy. If accurate energy surfaces are obtained, one can use established methods such as classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations to obtain accurate free energies, which provide the rates directly via the Erying equation [43]. At room temperature, a relative error in energy of 1.6 × 10 −3 hartree (1 kcal/mol or 0.043 eV) translates to a chemical rate that differs from the true value by an order of magnitude; therefore, 1.6 × 10 −3 hartree is known as “chemical accuracy ” [43]. Our goal, then, is to compute the lowest energy eigen- values of Eq. (1) as a function of R, to within chemical accuracy. II. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM EIGENSOLVER Many popular classical approximation methods for the electronic structure problem involve optimizing a parametrized guess wave function (known as an “ansatz”) according to the variational principle [43]. If we para- metrize an ansatz jφð~θÞi by the vector ~θ, then the variational principle holds that hφð~θÞjHjφð~θÞi hφð~θÞjφð~θÞi ≥ E0; ð2Þ where E0 is the smallest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian H. Accordingly, E0 can be estimated by selecting the param- eters ~θ that minimize the left-hand side of Eq. (2). While the ground-state wave function is likely to be in superposition over an exponential number of states in the basis of molecular orbitals, most classical approaches restrict the ansatz to the support of polynomially many basis elements due to memory limitations. However, quantum circuits can prepare entangled states, which are not known to be efficiently representable classically. In VQE, the state jφð~θÞi is parametrized by the action of a quantum circuit Uð~θÞ on an initial state jϕ i; i.e., P . J. J. O’MALLEY et al. PHYS. REV . X 6, 031007 (2016) 031007-2 jφð~θÞi ≡ Uð~θÞjϕ i.E v e ni fjϕ i is a simple product state and Uð~θÞ is a very shallow circuit, jφð~θÞi can contain complex many-body correlations and span an exponential number of standard basis states. We can express the mapping Uð~θÞ as a concatenation of parametrized quantum gates, U 1ðθ1ÞU2ðθ2Þ…UnðθnÞ. In this work, we parametrize our circuit according to unitary coupled cluster theory [20,22,23]. As described in Appendix D, unitary coupled cluster theory predicts that the ground state of Eq. (1) can be expressed as jφðθÞi ¼ e−iθX0Y1 j01i; ð3Þ where jϕ i¼j 01i is the Hartree-Fock (mean-field) state of molecular hydrogen in the representation of Eq. (1). As discussed in Appendix D, unitary coupled cluster theory is widely believed to be classically intractable and is known to be strictly more powerful than the “gold standard ” of classical electronic structure theory, coupled cluster theory [43–46]. The gate model circuit that performs this unitary mapping is shown in the software section of Fig. 1. VQE solves for the parameter vector ~θ with a classical optimization routine. One first prepares an initial ansatz jφð~θ 0Þi and then estimates the ansatz energy Eð~θ0Þ by measuring the expectation values of each term in Eq. (1) and summing these values together as Eð~θÞ¼ X γ gγhφð~θÞjHγjφð~θÞi; ð4Þ where the gγ are scalars and the Hγ are local Hamiltonians as in Eq. (1). The initial guess ~θ0 and the corresponding objective value Eð~θ0Þ are then fed to a classical greedy minimization routine (e.g., gradient descent), which then suggests a new setting of the parameters ~θ1. The energy Eð~θ1Þ is then measured and returned to the classical outer loop. This continues for m iterations until the energy converges to a minimum value Eð~θmÞ, which represents the VQE approximation to E0. Because our experiment requires only a single varia- tional parameter, as in Eq. (3), we elect to scan 1000 different values of θ ∈ ½−π; πÞ in order to obtain expect- ation values that define the entire potential energy curve. We do this to simplify the classical feedback routine but at the cost of needing slightly more experimental trials. These expectation values are shown in Fig. 2(a) and the corre- sponding energy surfaces at different bond lengths are shown in Fig. 2(b). The energy surface in Fig. 2(b) is locally optimized at each bond length to emulate an on-the- fly implementation. Figure 3(a) shows the exact and experimentally deter- mined energies of molecular hydrogen at different bond lengths. The minimum energy bond length ( R ¼ 0.72 Å) corresponds to the equilibrium bond length, whereas the asymptote on the right-hand part of the curve corresponds to dissociation into two hydrogen atoms. The energy difference between these points is the dissociation energy, and the exponential of this quantity determines the chemi- cal dissociation rate. Our VQE experiment correctly pre- dicts this quantity with an error of ð8 /C6 5Þ × 10 −4 hartree, which is below the chemical accuracy threshold. Error bars FIG. 1.

(Software) quantum circuit diagram shows preparation of the Hartree-Fock state, followed by application of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz in Eq. (3) and efficient partial tomography ( R t)t o measure the expectation values in Eq. (1). Finally, the total energy is computed according to Eq. (4) and provided to a classical optimizer which suggests new parameters. SCALABLE QUANTUM SIMULA TION OF MOLECULAR ENERGIES PHYS. REV . X 6, 031007 (2016) 031007-3 are computed with Gaussian process regression [47], which interpolates the energy surface based on local errors from the shot-noise-limited expectation value measurements in Fig. 2(a). Errors in our simulation as a function of R are shown in Fig. 3(b).T h ec u r v ei nF i g .3(b) becomes nearly flat past R ¼ 2.5 Å because the same angle is experimentally chosen for each R past this point. Note that the exper- imental energies are always greater than or equal to the exact energies due to the variational principle. Figure 3(b) shows that VQE has substantial robustness to systematic errors. While this possibility had been pre- viously hypothesized [23], we report the first experimen- tal signature of robustness and show that it allows for a successful computation of the dissociation energy. By performing (inefficient) classical simulations of the circuit in Fig. 1, we identify the theoretically optimal value of θ at each R. In fact, for this system, at every value of R there exists θ such that EðθÞ¼ E 0.H o w e v e r ,d u et oe x p e r i - mental error, the theoretically optimal value of θ differs substantially from the experimentally optimal value of θ. This can be seen in Fig. 3(b) from the large discrepancy between the green diamonds (experimental energy errors at theoretically optimal θ) and the red dots (experimental energy errors at experimentally optimal θ). The exper- imental energy curve at theoretically optimal θ shows an error in the dissociation energy of 1.1 × 10−2 hartree, which is more than an order of magnitude worse. One could anticipate this discrepancy by looking at the raw data in Fig. 2(a),w h i c hs h o w st h a tt h ee x p e r i m e n t a l l y measured expectation values deviate considerably from the predictions of theory. In a sense, the green diamonds in Fig. 3(b) show the performance of a nonvariational algorithm, which in theory gives the exact answer, but in practice fails due to systematic errors. III. PHASE ESTIMATION ALGORITHM We also report an experimental demonstration of the original quantum algorithm for chemistry [2]. Similar to VQE, the first step of this algorithm is to prepare the system register in a state having good overlap with the ground state of the Hamiltonian H. In our case, we begin with the Hartree-Fock state jϕ i. We then evolve this state under H using a Trotterized approximation to the time-evolution operator. The execution of this unitary is controlled on an ancilla initialized in the superposition state ðj0iþj 1iÞ= ﬃﬃ ﬃ 2 p . The time-evolution operator can be approximated using Trotterization [34] as e −iHt ¼ e−it P γgγHγ ≈ UTrotðtÞ ≡ /C18 Y γe−igγHγt=ρ /C19 ρ ; ð5Þ where the Hγ are local Hamiltonians as in Eq. (1) and the error in this approximation depends linearly on the time step ρ−1 [34]. Application of the propagator induces a phase on the system register so that e−iHtjϕ i¼ /C18 X n e−iEntjnihnj /C19 jϕ i¼ X n ane−iEntjni; ð6Þ where jni are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian such that Hjni¼ Enjni and an ¼h njϕ i. By controlling this evolu- tion on the ancilla superposition state, one entangles the system register with the ancilla. Accordingly, by measuring the phase between the j0i state and j1i state of the ancilla, FIG. 2. V ariational quantum eigensolver: raw data and computed energy surface.

While such systematic phase errors would prove disastrous for PEA, our VQE experiment is robust to this effect. (b) Experimentally measured energies (in hartree) as a function of θ and R.
