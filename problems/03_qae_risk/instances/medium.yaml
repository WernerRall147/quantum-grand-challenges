# Notes  
notes: |
  This medium instance represents realistic financial risk analysis:
  - Mixed distribution captures market stress scenarios
  - 1% precision is typical for regulatory risk reporting
  - Resource requirements approach fault-tolerant thresholds
  - Demonstrates emerging quantum advantage for high precision
  
  Key considerations:
  - Fat-tailed distributions are harder to sample classically
  - Multiple risk thresholds could be analyzed simultaneously
  - Quantum advantage becomes clear at this precision level
  
# Success Criteria
validation:
  max_error_vs_theoretical: 0.01    # 1% error tolerance
  quantum_classical_agreement: 0.005 # Should agree within 0.5%
  resource_efficiency: "acceptable"   # Within 2x of theoretical estimates
