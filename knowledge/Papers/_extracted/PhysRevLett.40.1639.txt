VOLUME 40, NUMBER 25 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 19 JvNE 1978 Radiation-Pressure Cooling of Bound Resonant Absorbers D. J. Wineland, H. E. Drullinger, and F. L. Walls Time and Frequency Division, National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado 80303 (Received 26 April 1978) We report the first observation of radiation-pressure cooling on a system of resonant absorbers which are elastically bound to a laboratory fixed apparatus. Mg II ions con- fined in a Penning electromagnetic trap are cooled to &40 K by irradiating them with the 8-pW output of a frequency doubled, single-made dye laser tuned to the low-frequency 3 1~side of the Doppler profile on the S~/& P&~& (M&=+2 itI/IJ =+2 or M J 2 M J 2) transitions. Cooling to approximately 10 K should be possible. Any scheme to improve fundamentally the re- solution and accuracy of high-resolution spectros- copy (rf as well as optical) beyond the present limits must incorporate sub-Doppler techniques and a means to suppress substantially the second- order and residual first-order Doppler effects. In the following we report the first experimental evidence that bound absorbers can be cooled via radiation pressure thereby fundamentally reducing both the first- and second-order Doppler ef- fects. The use of radiation pressure for cooling was independently suggested for the case of a gas of neutral atoms' and for ions bound in an electromagnetic trap' and has also been incor- porated into the suggested schemes for optical trapping. " Methods for significantly cooling electrons and ions contained in electromagnetic traps via radiation darnPing or collisions with cold gas have been known for some time' ', how- ever, these techniques do not provide cooling of atomic ions much below room temperature. It has recently been demonstrated' that the magne- tron motion of electrons in a Penning trap can be cooled by nonlinear excitation of the other de- grees of freedom. The method of radiation-pres- sure cooling demonstrated here offers the pos- siblity to cool substantially all degrees of free- doD1 ~ The method is outlined for the case of a har- monically bound resonant absorber (resonance frequency u, ) which is constrained to move along the x axis. We assume that its velocity is given by u„=v p cos 2» t where v„ is its vibrational fre- quency and that the natural linewidth (&v) is less than v„. The observed spectrum of the absorber in the laboratory contains the central resonance line with fir st-order-Doppler-eff ect- generated sidebands separated by v„having intensity J„'(v,v,/ cv„) (with n a positive or negative integer) when observed in the direction of motion; here, J„is the Bessel function of order n. If we irradiate the absorber with photons of frequency vL, =vp +nv„, the frequencies of the resonantly scattered photons occur at vp and symmetrically around vp at the sideband frequencies op+ v „vp+ 2v„, ... . Therefore, although photons of energy h(v, +nv„) are absorbed, on the average photons of energy hop are reemitted; when n is negative, this ener- gy difference causes the kinetic energy of the ab- sorber to decrease by Inhv„l per scattering event. In our experiments, &v»v„; however, the above conclusion is still valid. An alternative explana- tion is that when v& & v„ the absorber predomi- nantly interacts with the incident radiation when it moves towards the source of radiation and Dop- pler shifts the frequency into resonance, i.e., when v~(1+v„/c) =v,. In the absorption process, the photon momentum is first transferred to the absorber causing its momentum to change by h/A. (A,v~ =c) and since the emission occurs symmetri- cally in the +x directions, the net effect is to change the velocity of the absorber by Lv„=h/MA. (M =mass of absorber). If &v„«v„ then the kinetic energy of the absorber decreases by an amounts„An„=nhv„. Through the harmonic binding force, virtually all of the photon recoil momentum is eventually transferred to the "lat- tice" (trap structure in this case); however, since the mass of this lattice is very large, the energy change occurs in the vibrational motion. Note that, when ~a& v„, scattering of photons with energy hop is equivalent to the Mossbauer effect. In our experiments we store approximately 5 && 10' Mg II ions (density approximately 2 x 10'j cm') in a copper Penning tap with hyperbolic elec- trodes of characteristic dimensions" rp =1.64zp =0.63 cm. Typical operating parameters are &p =7 V andBp=1. 3 T. The motion of an ion in the trap is comprised of a harmonic oscillation along the axial (z) direction (frequency v,) plus a com- posite of circular cyclotron motion (frequency v, ') superimposed upon a circular magnetron motion (frequency vg in the x-y plane.

For the above operating param- eters, v, =205 kHz, v,'=798 kHz, and v =26 kHz. The trap apparatus is mounted in an enclosure at high vacuum allowing observed ion thermaliza- tion times due to collisions with the background gas as long as 30 min and storage times of ap- proximately 1 day. Mg is emitted from an oven and ions are formed by an electron beam coinci- dent with the trap axis. Because the oven is ap- proximately 0.5 cm from the trap, the tempera- ture of the trap and therefore of the background gas is elevated above room temperature. Ther- mal motion of the ions induces currents in the trap electrodes yielding a signal proportional to NT (N =ion number, & =ion temperature). " Since the time for the cooling experiments is much less than the ion storage time and since observations confirm that the laser does not eject ions from the trap, N can be assumed con- stant. Therefore the signal provides a direct measurement of ion temperature. The radiation for the experiments is derived from the frequency-doubled output of a single- mode, c.w. , Rhodamine-110 dye laser. In the spectral region of interest (- 560 nm), this laser has a power output of approximately 250 mW in a 1-MHz bandwidth when pumped with 3 W of 514.5- nm radiation from an Ar' laser. The dye laser can be continuously tuned across 30 GHz and is frequency doubled into the uv with a 90'-phase- matched AD*P (deuterated ammonia dihydrogen phosphate) crystal. This allows us to tune across the 'S,y,—'P,g, (M~ = + —,' —M ~ = +2) transitions in one sweep. The uv output (up to 40 p W) is con- fined in a 1-2-mm-diam beam and is polarized perpendicular to the trap/magnet axis. It is in- troduced to and exits from holes in the ring elec- trode of the trap. In a magnetic field the 'S,i,—'P,i, transition splits according to the electronic Zeeman effect. The laser radiation is nearly uncoupled from the ~ =0 transitions due to the polarization; more- over, all of the 1M~I =-,' —IM& I = 2 transitions optically pump the ground state. However, the ~J = +&—MJ =+ 2 transitions can be driven many times in succession and provide the transitions for cooling. Figure 1(a) shows an experimental trace of ion temperature versus uv frequency (aj 350K FIG. l. Ion temperature vs swept laser frequency. Arrows above the traces show the direction of the sweep. The two resonance curves correspond to the Sg/'2 I'gg2 Q J 2 J - 2 and MJ=+2 M J=+ ~) transitions. When the laser frequency sweep is positive, the transitions are indicated by a temperature decrease; when the sweep is negative the transitions are indicated by an increase in temperature. Curve b is displaced upward and the baseline is not shown. d Q/dt = Ch (vi- v,)o,(vi)I(vt)/hvar, (2) where 1(vt.) is the laser flux (W/cm') and C is a factor (1 describing the overlap of the laser beam with the ion cloud. The cross section o',(vi) is given by the convolution of the natural line shape with the Doppler profile. When &v is much less than the Doppl'er width, v, (vL) can be given by Av/7T vg —vov, (v, ) = v, exp2vD VD where op is the resonance scattering cross sec- tion (r~&&' for the transitions here) and where v& =—(2'/M)' 'v,/c. The monitored signal is pro- portional to the temperature of the strongly coupled cyclotron and axial motions but not to the ma, gnetron motion. "' Moreover the laser only weakly couples to the magnetron motion (see below) and therefore each ion has a specific heat of 2k (k =Boltzman's constant). Using Eqs. (2) when the laser is swept from low to high frequen- cies through the 'S,i,—'P,i, manifold. A decrease in temperature is observed at two frequencies cor- responding to the separation of the +~—+& and —&——& transitions. As the radiation frequency is swept up through the low-frequency side of the Doppler profile on either transition, it cools the ions. When line center is reached, cooling stops; and as the laser sweeps through the high-frequen- cy side of the Doppler profile, heating occurs. Conversely, if the laser frequency is swept down through the transitions, heating appears first and then cooling. [See Fig. 1(b).] The rate of heat extraction (addition) per ion is given by 1640 VOLUME 40, NUMBER 25 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 19 JvNE 1978 and (3) the rate of temperature change is therefore dT 1 dQ I(vI)oo&Ai(vz, —vo) vl, —vol~ dt 2k dt 4vDv~k vn - exp (4) When the laser frequency is swept across the line so that vL, —v, =vt (v =dvl-/dt) and when I(v~) equals a constant value I„ then in the limit of small cooling (heating) where vD is nearly constant, Eq.

The maximum cool- ing rate is expected when v~=v, —vnW2. Note that for small temperature changes the observed line shape (temperature versus frequency) should re- produce the normal Doppler line shape. For the curves in Fig. 1, I,= 4 pW/mm' for the —2 —-2 and 6 p, W/mm' for the +2—+~ transitions, C =0.5, v'=0. 1 GHz/sec, and" hv =43 MHz, yield- ing a factor 250 K in front of the exponential in Eq. (5). The ambient (trap) temperature was measured to be approximately 350+ 50 K by in- frared means. The observed cooling (heating) (-100 K) is not as strong as predicted which may be caused by the observed presence of other ions in trap which reduces the net effect or by too high an estimate of C. The observed splitting of the lines ( 37 GHz) agrees with the value predicted based on magnetic field measurements to about 3%. The mean frequency of the two lines agrees with the reported value" to within 0.02 cm ' by com- parison of the dye-laser output to the spectrum of I,. The observed width of the lines (4.5 GHz) is larger than that predicted from the ambient tem- perature (2.9 GHz) and is partially caused by the magnetron-motion Doppler broadening and pos- sibly the slightly shifted resonances of the "Mg and "Mg isotopes (about 1(% each). We note, however, that if we cool the ions to one-half of their equilibrium temperature, and then sweep through the transition, the linesoidth dec~eases by a factor of approximately 1.5 as expected. In Fig. 2 a plot of temperature versus time is shown for the case when vL, —v, is constant and the laser is turned on for a fixed time as shown. The ions had previously been heated with the la- ser to about 700 K. I aser cooling is then im- plemented for a fixed time showing the ion tem- perature approaching 0 K with an upper bound of 40 K determined by the noise. After the laser is turned off, the ions rethermalize as shown. WithI, =8 pW, v~ —v, = —(2+1) GHz, we measure a cooling rate of 5 K/sec but predict a rate of 15+ ~» K/sec based on Eq. (4) evaluated at T =350 K. For this trace the background gas pressure was purposely made higher to reduce the thermal- ization time. The laser can couple to the magnetron motion and we must estimate this effect. If we use Eq. (1) and its time derivative we can relate a given velocity change, ~u, to a change in magnetron radius by the expression Zr„= ihv/(&, ' —~ ). For each scattering event &v =eh'/MA. which causes the magnetron orbit size to change by I hr„l= 1 x l0 cm. If we irradiate the ion cloud uniformly, Ir I increases in a radom walk with step size lhr I; this is a small effect. Moreover, if one irradiates the cloud preferentially on the side of the trap where the magnetron motion recedes from the laser, the magnetron vector should become smaller. This can be used to overcome the dif- fusion of ions out of the trap due to collisions and therefore indefinite confinement should be pos- sible. We have mapped the ion cloud shape by measuring the cooling (heating) signal strengths a as a function of laser beam position and found r (max) = 1 mm and z (max) = 0.5 mm. FIG. 2. Ion temperature vs time when laser cooling is applied for fixed v& —vo. The ions were initially heated above equilibrium temperature with the laser. Laser oqoling was then applied on the —2 —2 transi- tion for a fixed time until a temperature approaching 0 K ((40 K) was achieved. After the laser is turned off, the ions rethermalize to the ambient temperature. 1641 VQLUME 40, &(UMBER 25 PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 19JUNE 1978 The ultimate limit on cooling is determined by a competition of the damping rate on the vibra- tional energy due to laser cooling and the "noise" excitation of the vibrational energy due to the random occurrence (in time) of the photon impuls- es. In the limit where v„«&v and when one tunes for maximum cooling (vz, —v, =- s&v), the resulting kinetic energy is approximately equal to hb. v/8 corresponding to T = 0.5 && 10 ' K for the transitions discussed here. One can use the scat- tered photons from the cooling process as a moni- tor in a double-resonance experiment. Since the laser is not needed for trapping, it can be turned off for a relatively long time while the resonance of interest is probed. The possiblity also exists to use a mixture of ion—one kind which can be laser cooled and by collisions cools the other kind which are the ions of spectroscopic interest. %e note that the cooling method is quite general and can in principle be applied to other cases such as ions or nuclei bound in solid lattice.
