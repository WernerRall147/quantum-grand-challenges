# Problem 16 · Quantum Error Correction

## Overview

Fault-tolerant quantum computing demands error correction codes that suppress noisy qubit failures faster than they accumulate. This scaffold supplies a reproducible classical baseline for repetition-code style logical error analysis while standing up a Q# project that will ultimately host stabilizer simulations and surface-code primitives. By comparing physical error rates against logical failure probabilities we track where quantum error correction (QEC) begins to pay off.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd problems/16_error_correction

# Classical logical error analysis
python python/classical_baseline.py

# Plot logical error curves and suppression heatmaps
python python/analyze.py

# Quantum placeholder (requires .NET 6)
dotnet build qsharp/QuantumQEC.csproj
 dotnet run --project qsharp/QuantumQEC.csproj
```

## Next Quantum Milestones

1. **Stabilizer Simulation** – Implement syndrome extraction cycles for repetition or surface codes.
2. **Decoder Integration** – Explore minimum-weight matching or belief propagation within Q#.
3. **Resource Accounting** – Track qubit counts, circuit depth, and ancilla demand per cycle.
4. **Fault-Tolerant Benchmarks** – Compare logical error suppression across physical noise models.

This scaffold keeps the analytical QEC baseline reproducible while we build toward full stabilizer simulations in Q#. 🛡️⚛️

## Objective Maturity Gate

- **Current gate**: **Stage B complete** (classical baseline and Q# scaffold/build path are in place).
- **Next gate target**: **Stage C** (hardware-aware validation with uncertainty-bounded comparisons).

Stage C exit criteria for this problem:

- Execute at least one non-placeholder quantum workflow path tied to the problem objective.
- Report uncertainty-bounded comparisons between classical and quantum outputs on `small` and `medium` instances.
- Document transpilation/connectivity and backend assumptions used for reported quantum runs.
- Add calibration/noise-sensitivity evidence for the reported quantum metrics.

## Advantage Claim Contract

- **Claim category (current)**: `theoretical`.
- **Problem class and regime**: Problem-specific challenge instances defined in this directory.
- **Fair baseline**: Problem-local classical baseline in `python/` outputs.
- **Quantum resource scaling claim**: Expected asymptotic advantage depends on algorithm family and implementation assumptions; no hardware-demonstrated speedup claim yet.
- **Data-loading and I/O assumptions**: Must be documented alongside future advantage claims.
- **Noise/error model assumptions**: Backend-specific model and calibration assumptions to be added at Stage C.
- **Confidence/uncertainty method**: To be reported using shot-based confidence intervals or equivalent statistical bounds.
- **Residual risks**: Oracle/state-preparation/transpilation overhead may dominate for near-term instance sizes.
