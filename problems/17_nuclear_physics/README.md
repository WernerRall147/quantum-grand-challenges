# Problem 17 · Quantum Nuclear Physics

## Overview

Simulating few-nucleon systems requires capturing strong-interaction dynamics governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This scaffold provides a reproducible classical baseline using a pionless effective-field-theory (EFT) toy Hamiltonian solved via exact diagonalization, while preparing a Q# project for future adiabatic state preparation and Trotterized time evolution. The goal is to compare classical bound-state energy estimates with quantum-inspired workflows.

```

## Next Quantum Milestones

1. **Hamiltonian Encoding** – Map low-energy nucleon interactions into qubit-friendly operators.
2. **Adiabatic State Prep** – Implement adiabatic ramps or variational ansätze for ground-state estimation.
3. **Phase Estimation / Spectroscopy** – Use quantum phase estimation to extract binding energies.
4. **Resource Estimation** – Track qubit counts and Trotter step complexity across cutoff scales.

This scaffold keeps the EFT baseline reproducible while we work toward quantum-enhanced nuclear simulations. ⚛️🪐

## Objective Maturity Gate

- **Current gate**: **Stage B complete** (classical baseline and Q# scaffold/build path are in place).
- **Next gate target**: **Stage C** (hardware-aware validation with uncertainty-bounded comparisons).

Stage C exit criteria for this problem:

- Execute at least one non-placeholder quantum workflow path tied to the problem objective.
- Report uncertainty-bounded comparisons between classical and quantum outputs on `small` and `medium` instances.
- Document transpilation/connectivity and backend assumptions used for reported quantum runs.
- Add calibration/noise-sensitivity evidence for the reported quantum metrics.

## Advantage Claim Contract

- **Claim category (current)**: `theoretical`.
- **Problem class and regime**: Problem-specific challenge instances defined in this directory.
- **Fair baseline**: Problem-local classical baseline in `python/` outputs.
- **Quantum resource scaling claim**: Expected asymptotic advantage depends on algorithm family and implementation assumptions; no hardware-demonstrated speedup claim yet.
- **Data-loading and I/O assumptions**: Must be documented alongside future advantage claims.
- **Noise/error model assumptions**: Backend-specific model and calibration assumptions to be added at Stage C.
- **Confidence/uncertainty method**: To be reported using shot-based confidence intervals or equivalent statistical bounds.
- **Residual risks**: Oracle/state-preparation/transpilation overhead may dominate for near-term instance sizes.
