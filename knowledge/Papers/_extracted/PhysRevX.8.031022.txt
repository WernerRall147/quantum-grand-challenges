We report on the experimental implementation of such an algorithm to solve a quantum chemistry problem, using a digital quantum simulator based on trapped ions. Specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to calculate the molecular ground-state energies of two simple molecules and experimentally demonstrate and compare different encoding methods using up to four qubits.

INTRODUCTION Quantum simulators [1–5] are widely recognized for their promise to help solve challenging problems in a range of fields, including physics, chemistry, and materials science. First suggested by Feynman in the early 1980s [6], quantum simulators aim to harness controlled quantum evolutions in order to simulate other quantum systems. Later refined to a formalized notion of a universal quantum computer [7], a quantum simulator ’s main pur- pose is to turn the exponential scaling of resources needed to simulate quantum systems on classical computers into a more favorable polynomial overhead on a quantum machine. Experimentally pioneered at the turn of the millennium by nuclear magnetic resonance [8], neutral atom [9], and trapped-ion [10] systems, quantum simu- lation has attracted much attention over the last decade and might well hold the key to unlock significant advances in our understanding of many-body physics [11]. In the analog approach to quantum simulation, the interactions of a quantum system are engineered to closely match the Hamiltonian of the system of interest. Starting from a well-defined initial state, the simulator evolves under a tailored Hamiltonian to a final state, and measure- ments are taken that reveal the sought-after information about the system of interest. Prominent examples are experiments realizing Bose- or Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms [12], or long-range spin models using either up to 20 fully controlled [13–18] or over 100 entangled ions [19–21]. The digital approach to quantum simulation employs computational gates to approximate the time evolution of arbitrary local Hamiltonians. This can be done in a freely programmable way [7] that is amenable to quantum error correction [22,23]. With a versatility similar to classical computers, digital quantum simulators offer the prospect to shed light on properties of systems that are fundamentally different from the simulator.

PHYSICAL REVIEW X 8, 031022 (2018) 2160-3308=18=8(3)=031022(22) 031022-1 Published by the American Physical Society trapped ions that simulate high-energy physics processes are an example [24]. The first multiqubit demonstrations of the technique on scalable platforms were implemented on trapped ions [25] and a superconducting system [26]. To enable quantum simulations with a level of complex- ity that is beyond the reach of classical computers, multiple avenues are being pursued to scale up universal quantum processors realized on platforms such as trapped ions or superconducting qubits [27,28]. As experimental progress paves the way towards the realization of larger-scale devices, it is important to develop algorithms that make efficient use of these continually improving quantum resources. Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms have recently emerged; they leverage the unique capabilities of quantum devices by incorporating them in classical numerical calculations. In this article, we use a digital quantum simulator based on trapped ions to experimentally investigate one such algorithm, the variational quantum eigensolver [29–31] for the calculation of molecular ground-state energies. We begin with a review of the underlying methods of quantum chemistry, as well as the overall algorithmic approach, and briefly summarize previous experimental implementations. We then introduce our experimental realization and present results for two example molecules —molecular hydrogen and lithium hydride. Finally, we discuss the results and sources of error with respect to a threshold known as chemical accuracy, and we provide suggestions for further improvements of the algorithm. II. SIMULATING QUANTUM CHEMISTRY A. Approach and specific steps While quantum computers have been shown to offer exponential speedups for a variety of problems, a particu- larly compelling application is the quantum computation of molecular energies [32–34]. Efficient quantum simulations of classically intractable instances of the associated elec- tronic structure problem promise breakthroughs in our understanding of basic chemistry and could revolutionize research into new materials, pharmaceuticals, and industrial catalysts. In the last few years, many efforts have sought to develop new algorithms [35–41] and better implementation strategies [42–49] for these simulations. Among the explored approaches, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm [29–31] has been shown experimentally to be resilient to some systematic errors [50] from imperfect control pulses, making it a promising candidate for quan- tum simulations in the near term [51]. VQEs belong to the class of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms where a classical subroutine is enhanced by the computational power of a quantum simulator. Given its potential for near-term use, the VQE approach is increas- ingly receiving attention in both theoretical [31,40,51–59] and experimental works [30,50,60–65], with a focus on both quantum chemistry and fundamental physics and materials science. We now discuss the simulation of quantum chemistry in more detail. The central problem of theoretical chemistry is to compute the lowest-energy eigenvalue of the molecular electronic structure Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian determine almost all of the properties of interest in a molecule or material, and as the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state is often much larger than 25.7 meV ( k BT at room temperature), the ground state is of particular interest. To arrive at the standard form of this Hamiltonian used in quantum computation, one begins from a collection of nuclear charges Z i and a number of electrons in the system for which the corresponding Hamiltonian is written as H1 ¼ − X i ∇2 Ri 2Mi − X i ∇2ri 2 − X i;j Zi jRi − rjj þ X i;j>i ZiZj jRi − Rjj þ X i;j>i 1 jri − rjj ð1Þ in atomic units ðℏ ¼ 1Þ. Here, the positions, masses, and charges of the nuclei are Ri, Mi, Zi, and the positions of the electrons are ri. This form of the Hamiltonian and its real-space discretization is often referred to as the first- quantized formulation of quantum chemistry and generally enforces the fermionic nature of the electron through an antisymmetric wave function. Several approaches have been developed for treating this form of the problem on a quantum computer [35,66–70]; however, the focus of this work is on the second-quantized formulation. To reach the second quantized formulation, one typically first approximates the nuclei as fixed classical point charges under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and chooses a basis ϕ i in which to represent the electronic wave function. Often, one chooses a basis of N molecular orbitals, constructed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), which are computed using a mean-field procedure known in chemistry as the Hartree-Fock (HF) method [71]. The atomic orbital basis functions are derived from variations of hydrogenlike atomic orbitals for differ- ent values of Z. They are numerically optimized to match desired physical properties across a range of systems and to be compatible with systematic improvement [72]. Usually, the basis functions are expressed as sums of Gaussian functions rather than the original Slater-type orbitals to enhance the efficiency of integral evaluation. This choice is convenient for small problems but not mandatory, and much work has been done recently to improve the Hamiltonian representation for electronic structure problems [40,41]. CORNELIUS HEMPEL et al. PHYS. REV . X 8, 031022 (2018) 031022-2 The second-quantized formulation of quantum chemistry leads to the (electronic) Hamiltonian H2 ¼ X pq hpqa† paq þ 1 2 X pqrs hpqrsa† pa† q aras; ð2Þ in which the wave function ’s antisymmetry is enforced through the anticommutation relations of the fermion creation and annihilation operators a † i and aj. The goal now is to compute the energy of electrons interacting in the fixed external potential of the atomic nuclei. Encoding the electron’s spatial and spin coordinates as σi ¼ð ri;s iÞ, the two sets of scalar coefficients in Eq. (2) can be calculated via hpq ¼ Z dσϕ /C3pðσÞ /C18 ∇2r 2 − X i Zi jRi − rj /C19 ϕ /C3qðσÞ hpqrs ¼ Z dσ1dσ2 ϕ /C3pðσ1Þϕ /C3qðσ2Þϕ sðσ1Þϕ rðσ2Þ jr1 − r2j : ð3Þ In order to implement the Hamiltonian on a qubit-based quantum simulator, the specific fermionic Hamiltonians need to be transformed to spin Hamiltonians. The most common schemes for this transformation are the Jordan- Wigner (JW) transformation [73,74] and the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) transformation [68,74–79]. Characteristically, the JW transformation leads to N-local Hamiltonians, and the BK transformation leads to log ðNÞ-local Hamiltonians. In this work, we explore both approaches to arrive at a spin Hamiltonian H, which can be implemented with qubits on a quantum simulator. VQE algorithms for quantum chemistry typically seek to prepare the ground state of the target system for a particular geometric configuration specified by ⃗R i. The energy land- scape created by this geometry for the electrons derives from the integrals in Eqs. (3) above and will be captured by scalar values cl throughout the remainder of the article. The calculation then proceeds along the following four steps, visually summarized in Fig. 1(b). (1) A digital quantum simulator is initialized in a simple state jφ ð0Þi, which represents a good classical approximation to the ground state of Hamiltonian H. When using a molecular orbital basis, this initialization is particularly straightforward, as the classical mean-field state (most often, a Hartree- Fock solution [71]) is a product state. (2) A quantum circuit implementing the unitary operation Uð⃗θ 0Þ is applied to jφ ð0Þi mapping the initial state to a parametrized “ansatz” state jφ ð⃗θ0Þi ¼ Uð⃗θ0Þjφ ð0Þi. The operation Uð⃗θ0Þ and its parameter vector ⃗θ0 are chosen based on known structure in the target system, which is usually obtained from classical approximation methods. (3) One measures the expectation value of the energy hHi¼h φ ð⃗θ0ÞjHjφ ð⃗θ0Þi of the prepared ansatz state. This makes use of the form of the Hamiltonian H ¼ P lclHl, where Hl are tensor products of Pauli matrices and cl the above-mentioned scalars that were precalculated for a given internuclear configuration ⃗Ri. Repeated rounds of state prepara- tion and measurement of the individual terms hHli allow one to provide an estimate for the expectation value hHi¼ P lclhHli. In this context, this step is often referred to as Hamiltonian averaging [30,31]. (4) One adjusts the parameters ⃗θ to minimize hHi.A n iterative classical “outer-loop” optimization (e.g., gradient descent) can be deployed for this purpose. Assuming this procedure converges after m itera- tions, the resulting state jφ ð⃗θmÞi represents the variational approximation to the molecular ground state at the chosen configuration ⃗Ri. It is worth noting that, when applied to classical (diagonal) Hamiltonians, the above strategy is the basis of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm [80].

A classical preprocessing stage (a) translates the chemical problem to a classical description of a quantum circuit for unitary operator Uð⃗θÞ that can be directly implemented on a quantum processor. (b) As outlined in the main text above, the four steps of the iterative variational optimization are performed in a loop combining quantum resources with a numerical search running on a classical computer. Finally, in (c), the full potential energy surface (PES) of the molecule in question, including both nuclear and electronic contributions, is reconstructed from the data. QUANTUM CHEMISTRY CALCULA TIONS ON A TRAPPED- … PHYS. REV . X 8, 031022 (2018) 031022-3 In order to obtain the total molecular energy of the potential energy surface, the mutual Coulomb energy of the nuclei, separated out in the Born-Oppenheimer approxi- mation of the classical preprocessing step before, has to be added to the VQE result at every configuration ⃗R i. A good ansatz unitary Uð⃗θÞ is typically chosen to balance the strengths of available experimental resources with insights about the structure of the fermionic system under study. For instance, it has been argued that a parameterized Trotter approximation [7,81] to the adiabatic state preparation algorithm may serve as an effective ansatz [40,41,51]. In this article, we parameterize our variational ansatz based on insights from a cornerstone method of modern electronic structure theory known as coupled cluster [82]. While widely regarded as the “gold standard” of accuracy for the classical study of strongly correlated systems, a drawback of the coupled-cluster ansatz is that the method is nonunitary, and there is no way to ensure that solutions are properly normalized. This can lead to significant errors when the ground state has what is referred to as multireference character, i.e., when it has significant support on more than one classical con- figuration within the chosen basis. To address this pro- blem, a unitary variant of the coupled-cluster method was proposed in Ref. [83]. However, while theoretically immune to some of the problems of the traditional method, unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) calculations cannot be performed efficiently on classical computers. Thus, the classical study of UCC involves additional approximations, which are also problematic in some cases [84].H o w e v e r ,a s first discussed in Ref. [30], one can perform finite-order UCC calculations efficiently on a quantum computer without any approximation [31,57]. UCC essentially suggests a series of fermionic operators that one should evolve under in order to prepare the electronic ground state. For instance, one can think of the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz in a Trotter approxima- tion as U UCCð⃗θÞ¼ e P γ θγðTγ−T† γÞ ≈ Y γ eθγðTγ−T† γÞ; ð4Þ where ðTγ − T† γÞ are anti-Hermitian fermionic excitation operators. The approximation associated with using only a single Trotter step for the exponential is generally accept- able since the coupled-cluster amplitudes θ γ are usually quite small. As discussed in Ref. [57], one can scalably deploy classical coupled-cluster calculations in order to get a reasonable initial guess of the amplitudes θ0. Furthermore, because of selection rules involving the symmetry point groups of molecular orbitals and suitable quantum numbers of the Hamiltonian, most of the coupled- cluster amplitudes associated with operators that one might naively anticipate need to be simulated are actually zero. A vast majority of the other amplitudes are typically extremely small [57], such that one may choose a threshold value for the ⃗θ 0 provided by the classical coupled-cluster method to further reduce the number of relevant eθγðTγ−T† γÞ terms. B. Previous demonstrations Experimental demonstrations of quantum chemistry algorithms have been performed on architectures ranging from quantum photonics [30,85,86], NV centers [61], ion traps [62,87], and NMR platforms [88,89], to supercon- ducting qubits [50,63,64]. The first realizations date back to 2010, when a photonic experiment [85] and a closely related NMR experiment [88] simulated the hydro
