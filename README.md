Lets start by understanding how we would structure a project that would begin to attempt to work on each of these problems. We can either use on GitHub repo or multiple repos but we have access to all the latest AI tools and coding agents. We can use codespaces, claude 4 sonnet, chatgpt 5 and pretty much any models that would help us code in Q#. Then lets structure a little mini rough plan about how this would work. Do we beed a multi agent solution for the agnets to work on this? How do we presnet the answers in the end, DO we need a frontend website that will present it all back to us and where we can simulate or showcase results? Lets explore

Love it. Here’s a practical, Q#-first blueprint you can start using today—lean on Codespaces + your AI copilots, keep it reproducible, and grow to multi-agent only where it truly helps.

1) Monorepo vs multi-repo

Recommend: a single monorepo quantum-grand-challenges/ with one standardized scaffold per problem type. It keeps shared Q# libraries (Grover/PEA/QAOA/HHL wrappers), common CI, and a single results website. If a track explodes (e.g., chemistry data), you can later split it to its own repo without breaking interfaces.

└─ docs/                         # High-level docs; Problem book; How-to run

2) Dev environment (one command to contribute)

Codespaces + devcontainer with:

Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) + VS Code extension, plus Jupyter/Python glue. 
Microsoft Learn

Azure CLI with the quantum extension (az extension add -n quantum) for job submit/list/output. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Resource Estimator (open-source, runs locally—no Azure account needed). 
Microsoft Learn
quantum.microsoft.com

Optional chemistry input support (Broombridge YAML) for electronic-structure problems. 
openqemist.1qbit.com
American Chemical Society Publications

3) Standard project template (per problem)

Each problems/*/ uses the same makefile/scripts:

Build & test Q# kernels.

Estimate: run Azure Quantum Resource Estimator with a chosen hardware profile; emit estimates/latest.json. (Profiles are editable target sheets—code distances, error rates, T-factory, etc.). 
Microsoft Learn

(Optional) Execute: submit to a simulator or hardware via az quantum job submit (IonQ/Quantinuum/OQC targets), then store runs/<timestamp>/outputs.json. 
IonQ

4) Results contract (JSON)

Uniform outputs make automation and the website trivial:

{
  "problem_id": "03_qae_risk",
  "algorithm": "QAE",
  "instance": {"seed": 42, "dist": "lognormal", "epsilon": 0.01},
  "estimator_target": "surface_code_generic_v1",
  "metrics": {
    "logical_qubits": 127,
    "physical_qubits": 1_800_000,
    "t_count": 2.3e11,
    "runtime_days": 4.2
  },
  "build": {"commit": "abc123", "qdk_version": "v1.x"},
  "date_utc": "2025-08-14T20:00:00Z",
  "notes": "ε=0.01; compared to classical MC 1e6 samples"
}


(Estimator targets are customizable per the docs. Keep these profiles in tooling/estimator/targets/ so comparisons are apples-to-apples.) 
Microsoft Learn

5) CI/CD flow (GitHub Actions)

CI (on PR): build Q#, run unit tests, quick estimator sanity (coarse precision).

Nightly “sweep”: run estimator across grids of precisions/targets; publish JSON artifacts.

Publish site: Next.js/Docusaurus reads problems/**/estimates/*.json, renders charts/tables, and links to raw artifacts.
(Estimator is local & free; submission to real hardware uses az quantum job submit and costs/queues—keep that optional & tagged.) 
Microsoft Learn

6) Where AI/agents help (and where they don’t)

Start single-agent orchestration (simpler, auditable), then grow to multi-agent if/when you hit coordination limits.

Phase A — Single orchestrator

Planner (Copilot/ChatGPT/Claude) that:

Reads paper/issue → emits task list + acceptance criteria.

Drafts Q# oracles/cost functions from a spec (PR opened with tests).

Writes estimator configs and analysis notebooks.

Phase B — Light multi-agent (hub-and-spoke)

Literature Miner → turns a DOI/arXiv into a structured “design brief”.

Kernel Engineer → proposes Q# interfaces, generates tests.

Experiment Runner → runs estimator sweeps; persists JSON.

Analyst/Publisher → turns JSON → charts + markdown summary; opens PR to the site.

Keep the “brain” simple (a workflow file or a tiny orchestrator script). Avoid autonomous long-running “agents” until you have stable interfaces and safety rails (rate-limits, review gates).

7) Presenting the answers (website + notebooks)

Website (static hosting in the repo):

Problem pages: background, instance definition, live charts from JSON (qubits, T-count, runtime vs precision/error rate, target comparisons).

“Compare” page: side-by-side hardware/target profiles from the Resource Estimator. 
Microsoft Learn

Notebooks: short, executable walk-throughs for each result (why the circuit/oracle is correct, classical baseline, estimator parameters).

Reproducibility badge: links to the exact commit + estimator target used.

Optional live runs: a “Run on Azure Quantum” button that calls a small GitHub Action to submit a job and attach the result (where meaningful). 
Microsoft Learn

8) Seeds you can implement this week

QAE for tail risk (problems/03_qae_risk/)

Q# amplitude estimation kernel; estimator sweep over ε ∈ {1e-1…1e-3}; classical MC baseline in Python.

Shows a clean quantum–classical trade-off (and connects to real finance/insurance workflows).

Shor resource study (problems/06_shor_resources/)

Implement modular exponentiation counts for RSA-2048; run estimator across code distances/error rates; publish cost curves for crypto-agility discussions. 
Microsoft Learn

HHL toy linear solver (problems/04_linear_solvers/)

Band-diagonal oracle; estimator vs. condition number κ, precision ε; compare to conjugate-gradient runtime. (Great teaching exemplar.)

Chemistry/Broombridge demo (problems/02_catalysis/)

Load a tiny active space from Broombridge YAML; VQE/PEA stub + estimator; establish the chemistry pipeline end-to-end. 
openqemist.1qbit.com

9) Scaffolding helpers you’ll want

QDK install & templates (VS Code) for contributors. 
Microsoft Learn

GitHub
quantum.microsoft.com

Modern QDK repo (issues/examples; language/tooling updates). 
GitHub

CLI for jobs (az quantum job submit/list/output/wait). 
Microsoft Learn

Resource Estimator docs (inputs/outputs, target parameterization). 
Microsoft Learn
+1
arXiv

10) Governance & DX niceties

Issue/PR templates: require a design brief (what circuit? what estimator target? acceptance checks).

Data retention: keep only latest JSON under estimates/ + an archive/ branch for large sweeps.

Licensing: MIT for code, CC-BY for docs.

Security: store Azure credentials as repo secrets for optional hardware runs; all “submit” steps behind manual approval.
